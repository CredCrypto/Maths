All That Fancy Math Stuff Goes Here ;-)

Seriosuly though, I have some ideas when it comes to the amount of coin being avialable and the potential limit(s) and challenges that this kind of currency faces. This will actually be one of the most distinguishing and desirable features of CredCrypto. Stay tuned...

I may be looking for a skilled mathematician soon so please feel free to ping me if interested. University students/grads welcome to apply. Incentives dependent on contribution made but consistent with hours contributed.
